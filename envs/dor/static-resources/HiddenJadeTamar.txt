Why was it called the dark ages? Because of all the knights. 
Why did the tomato blush? Because it saw the salad dressing.
Why does a Moon-rock taste better than an Earth-rock? Because it's a little meteor.
Slept like a log last night  woke up in the fireplace.
Why does a Moon-rock taste better than an Earth-rock? Because it's a little meteor.
