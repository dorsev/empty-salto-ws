What is a centipedes's favorite Beatle song?  I want to hold your hand, hand, hand, hand...
Why didnt the skeleton cross the road? Because he had no guts.
Why was it called the dark ages? Because of all the knights. 
I'll tell you what often gets over looked... garden fences.
To be Frank, I'd have to change my name.
