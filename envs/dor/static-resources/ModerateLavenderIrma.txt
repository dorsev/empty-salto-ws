What is a centipedes's favorite Beatle song?  I want to hold your hand, hand, hand, hand...
Slept like a log last night  woke up in the fireplace.
Why didnt the skeleton cross the road? Because he had no guts.
Did you hear about the guy whose whole left side was cut off? He's all right now.
Slept like a log last night  woke up in the fireplace.
Why did the tomato blush? Because it saw the salad dressing.
How come the stadium got hot after the game? Because all of the fans left.
Why didnt the skeleton cross the road? Because he had no guts.
