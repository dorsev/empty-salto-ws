A steak pun is a rare medium well done.
What did the father tomato say to the baby tomato whilst on a family walk? Ketchup.
Im only familiar with 25 letters in the English language. I dont know why.
I thought my wife was joking when she said she'd leave me if I didn't stop signing "I'm A Believer"... Then I saw her face.
Whoever invented the knock-knock joke should get a no bell prize.
