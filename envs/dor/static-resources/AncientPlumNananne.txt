I'm tired of following my dreams. I'm just going to ask them where they are going and meet up with them later.
Why was it called the dark ages? Because of all the knights. 
Why is Peter Pan always flying? Because he Neverlands.
Did you hear the joke about the wandering nun? She was a roman catholic.
I'll tell you what often gets over looked... garden fences.
Slept like a log last night  woke up in the fireplace.
I thought my wife was joking when she said she'd leave me if I didn't stop signing "I'm A Believer"... Then I saw her face.
Did you hear about the guy whose whole left side was cut off? He's all right now.
Whoever invented the knock-knock joke should get a no bell prize.
Why do birds fly south for the winter? Because it's too far to walk.
