I'm tired of following my dreams. I'm just going to ask them where they are going and meet up with them later.
Why does a Moon-rock taste better than an Earth-rock? Because it's a little meteor.
Why didnt the skeleton cross the road? Because he had no guts.
I knew I shouldn't steal a mixer from work, but it was a whisk I was willing to take.
My first time using an elevator was an uplifting experience. The second time let me down.
