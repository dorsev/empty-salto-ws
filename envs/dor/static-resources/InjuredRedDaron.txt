Why does a Moon-rock taste better than an Earth-rock? Because it's a little meteor.
Why did the tomato blush? Because it saw the salad dressing.
Why is Peter Pan always flying? Because he Neverlands.
Why did the kid cross the playground? To get to the other slide.
What do you call two barracuda fish?  A Pairacuda!
Why is Peter Pan always flying? Because he Neverlands.
I'm tired of following my dreams. I'm just going to ask them where they are going and meet up with them later.
