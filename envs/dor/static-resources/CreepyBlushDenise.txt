Why didnt the skeleton cross the road? Because he had no guts.
I'm tired of following my dreams. I'm just going to ask them where they are going and meet up with them later.
Why does a Moon-rock taste better than an Earth-rock? Because it's a little meteor.
My first time using an elevator was an uplifting experience. The second time let me down.
I knew I shouldn't steal a mixer from work, but it was a whisk I was willing to take.
I'll tell you what often gets over looked... garden fences.
