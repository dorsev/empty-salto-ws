What did one nut say as he chased another nut?  I'm a cashew!
I'm tired of following my dreams. I'm just going to ask them where they are going and meet up with them later.
Did you know that protons have mass? I didn't even know they were catholic.
Did you hear the joke about the wandering nun? She was a roman catholic.
Why did the kid cross the playground? To get to the other slide.
Did you hear about the guy whose whole left side was cut off? He's all right now.
To be Frank, I'd have to change my name.
